  abstract    = {{A very general class of sampling methods without replacement and
	with unequal probabilities is proposed. It consists of splitting
	the inclusion probability vector into several new inclusion probability
	vectors. One of these vectors. is chosen randomly;:thus, the initial
	problem is reduced to another sampling problem with unequal probabilities.
	This splitting is then repeated on; these new vectors of inclusion
	probabilities; at each step,he sampling problem is reduced to a simpler
	problem. The simplicity of this technique allows one to generate
	easily new sampling procedures with unequal probabilities. The splitting
	method also generalises well-known methods such as the Midzuno method,
	the elimination procedure and the Chao procedure. Next, a sufficient
	condition is given in order that a splitting method satisfies the
	Sen-Yates-Grundy condition; Finally, it is shown that the elimination
	procedure satisfies the Gabler sufficient condition.}},

  abstract = {Abstract The optimization of spatial sampling by simulated annealing has been demonstrated and applied for a range of objective functions. In practice more than one objective function may be important for sampling, and there may be complex trade-offs between them. In this paper it is shown how a multi-objective optimization algorithm can be applied to a spatial sampling problem. This generates a set of solutions which is non-dominated (no one solution does better than any other on all objective functions). These solutions represent different feasible trade-offs between the objective functions, and a subset might be practically acceptable. The algorithm is applied to a hypothetical example of sampling for a regional mean with the variance of the mean and the total distance travelled between sample points as the two objective functions. The solutions represent a transition of sample arrays from a loose grid to a tight loop. The potential to develop this approach and apply it to other spatial sampling problems is discussed. },

  abstract  = {{Soil monitoring and inventory require a sampling strategy. One component
	of this strategy is the support of the basic soil observation: the
	size and shape of the volume of material that is collected and then
	analysed to return a single soil datum. Many, but not all, soil sampling
	schemes use aggregate supports in which material from a set of more
	than one soil cores, arranged in a given configuration, is aggregated
	and thoroughly mixed prior to analysis. In this paper, it is shown
	how the spatial statistics of soil information, collected on an aggregate
	support, can be computed from the covariance function of the soil
	variable on a core support (treated as point support). This is done
	via what is called here the discrete regularization of the core-support
	function. It is shown how discrete regularization can be used to
	compute the variance of soil sample means and to quantify the consistency
	of estimates made by sampling then re-sampling a monitoring network,
	given uncertainty in the precision with which sample sites are relocated.
	These methods are illustrated using data on soil organic carbon content
	from a transect in central England. Two aggregate supports, both
	based on a 20 m 20 m square, are compared with core support. It is
	shown that both the precision and the consistency of data collected
	on an aggregate support are better than data on a core support. This
	has implications for the design of sampling schemes for soil inventory
	and monitoring.}},

   science. In the geosciences they are used to discover the important
   spatial scales on which properties vary. However, while the practical
   advantages and disadvantages of various nested designs have been
   discussed, no attempt has been made to optimize nested sampling schemes.
   This paper shows how an optimal nested sampling design can be found by a
   method of numerical combinatorial optimization: simulated annealing. The
   sample design is optimized over a space of possible designs for a fixed
   sample size and predetermined levels (spatial scales). The objective
   function for optimization is based on the expected covariance matrix for
   errors in the estimates of variance components, and so depends on what
   those components are. By simulation it was shown that optimized sampling
   schemes can detect scale-dependent variance components with common
   requirements for statistical power on smaller total sample sizes than
   are required with commonly used spatially nested sample designs such as
   the balanced design. Although the optimized design depends on the
   underlying covariance structure, sampling designs can be identified that
   perform better than the commonly used ones over a wide range of
   conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

  abstract             = {{A reconnaissance survey was undertaken on soil near mine tailings to
   investigate variation in the content of copper, chromium and uranium. A
   nested sampling design was used. The data showed significant relations
   between the content of copper and uranium in the soil and its organic
   matter content, and a significant spatial trend in uranium content with
   distance from the tailings. Soil pH was not significantly related to any
   of the metals. The variance components associated with different scales
   of the sample design had large confidence intervals, but it was possible
   to show that the random variation was spatially dependent for all
   spatial models, whether for variation around a constant mean, or with a
   mean given by a linear effect of organic matter or distance to the
   tailings. For copper, we showed that a fractal or multifractal random
   model, with equal variance components for scales in a logarithmic
   progression, could be rejected for the model of variation around the
   fixed mean. The inclusion of organic matter as an explanatory factor
   meant that the fractal model could no longer be rejected, suggesting
   that the effect of organic matter results in spatial variation that is
   not scale invariant. It was shown, taking uranium as a case study, that
   further spatially nested sampling to estimate scale-dependent variance
   components, or to test a non-fractal model with adequate power, would
   require in the order of 200-250 samples in total.
   Highlights
   Sampling was undertaken to investigate spatial variation of metal
   content in soil near mine tailings.
   Chromium and uranium were related to soil organic matter content;
   uranium showed a spatial trend.
   Spatial variation was scale dependent, variation of copper was not
   scale-invariant.
   Characterizing random spatial variation requires substantial sample
   effort.}},
